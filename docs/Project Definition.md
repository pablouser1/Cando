Our project consists in creating a 2-player turn based puzzle videogame. The puzzle will have two parts, each assigned to a player. To complete the game, they will need to do parts of their puzzle by turns, to then pass clues or activate new functions for their partner. The controls will be easy to use, since the important part of the game will be the puzzle itself and the communication between the players will be made more difficult with little interferences in order to achieve a more interesting experience.
