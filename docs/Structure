Structure:

As we know, the Project will be divided in two week tasks where we will have to put in practice what we have learned in the several lessons in between those weeks. 
Based on that It would be convenient to do a Agile Management Structure Plan so we improve the project while learning the subject.
Our main idea in terms of tasks is to work in a communicative ambience in order to be able to de the different personal works with the full agreement of the team.

Rules: 
-Coding Style: google coding style.
-Materials: use the same programs, Git, Github and Visual Paradigm etc..
